# TN Staging System - Changelog

## [2.0.2] - 2025-06-25 - Guidelines Update & Tokenizer Enhancement

### üìÑ Updated Guidelines
- **New PDF**: `Oralcavity_oropharyngeal.pdf` with enhanced tabular structures
- **Enhanced Table Detection**: 4 medical tables successfully tokenized (p16+ and p16- cancer staging)
- **Improved Chunking**: 34 semantic chunks generated (optimized from previous 83)

### üîß Tokenizer Improvements
- **Fixed Metadata Bug**: `has_table` metadata now correctly identifies chunks with medical tables
- **Enhanced Pattern Matching**: Updated pattern from exact `"[MEDICAL TABLE]"` to flexible `"[MEDICAL TABLE"`
- **Better Retrieval**: Improved semantic search for table-containing chunks

### üßπ Project Organization
- **Cleanup**: Moved debugging and analysis scripts to `not_using/` directory
- **Documentation**: Updated all references to reflect new PDF and tokenization results

## [2.0.0] - 2024-06-24 - Production Release

### üöÄ Major Features Added

#### Interactive Workflow System
- **Query Generation**: Automatic question generation when staging confidence is low or TX/NX results
- **Enhanced Report Re-analysis**: Combines user responses with original reports for improved accuracy
- **Real-time Chat Interface**: Streamlit GUI with conversational workflow and history
- **Response Validation**: Smart handling of user responses with context preservation

#### Medical Accuracy Improvements
- **N0 vs NX Distinction**: Proper medical logic - N0 only with explicit negative findings, NX when unclear
- **Radiologic Context Awareness**: Questions focus on imaging findings, not pathology specimens
- **Confidence-based Validation**: Automatic query generation for uncertain staging (< 0.7 confidence)
- **AJCC Guideline Compliance**: Enhanced vector store retrieval with medical table extraction

### üîß Technical Improvements

#### LLM Response Handling
- **Enhanced JSON Parsing**: Robust handling of `<think>` tags across all agents
- **Fallback Text Parsing**: Multiple extraction patterns when JSON parsing fails
- **Response Cleaning**: Automatic removal of LLM artifacts and thinking tags
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful fallbacks with meaningful error messages

#### Architecture Enhancements
- **Agent-based System**: Clean separation of concerns with specialized agents
- **LLM-First Approach**: No hardcoded medical rules, all logic through LLM + guidelines
- **Session Management**: Comprehensive logging and context tracking
- **Provider Abstraction**: Support for Ollama, OpenAI, and hybrid configurations

#### User Interface
- **Streamlit GUI**: Production-ready web interface with chat history
- **Progress Indicators**: Real-time processing status and progress bars
- **Query Interface**: Dedicated input areas for responding to staging questions
- **Session Tracking**: Visual indicators for pending operations and query states

### ü©∫ Medical System Features

#### Staging Logic
- **T Staging Agent**: Direct LLM analysis with AJCC guideline integration
- **N Staging Agent**: Enhanced lymph node assessment with validation logic
- **Detection Agent**: Robust body part and cancer type identification
- **Query Agent**: Targeted question generation for missing information

#### Guidelines Integration
- **Vector Store Retrieval**: FAISS-based AJCC guideline storage and retrieval
- **Table Extraction**: Enhanced PDF processing with medical table preservation
- **Contextual Retrieval**: Body part and cancer type specific guideline fetching
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: LLM-based guideline simulation when vector store unavailable

### üìä Performance & Quality

#### System Performance
- **Analysis Time**: 1-3 minutes per report (optimized for accuracy)
- **Memory Efficiency**: ~2GB RAM including vector stores
- **PyTorch-Free**: Removed heavy dependencies for cleaner deployment
